ACE OF CUPS

An emotional opening appears. It may feel quiet or subtle, but it is real enough to be noticed. Something begins to be felt before it is understood.

This card invites reflection.

What feeling is asking for space right now?
Where am I more open than I realize?

Emotions do not arrive with instructions.
They ask to be acknowledged.
