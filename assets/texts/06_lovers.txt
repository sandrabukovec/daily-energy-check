THE LOVERS

A choice appears, not between good and bad, but between alignment and compromise. Desire, value, and consequence meet in the same moment. What is chosen here begins to shape identity.

The Lovers invite reflection.

What choice am I currently avoiding by staying undecided?
Where does attraction conflict with what I know to be true?

Connection reveals direction.
It also exposes what cannot be chosen at the same time.
