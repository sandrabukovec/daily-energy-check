KNIGHT OF SWORDS

Thought accelerates into action. Ideas are pursued with urgency and conviction. Speed replaces consideration.

This card invites reflection.

Where am I acting on conclusions without fully testing them?
What am I pushing forward mentally at all costs?

Momentum sharpens intent.
It can override nuance.
