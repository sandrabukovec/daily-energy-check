THE FOOL

He arrives without a plan and without a story to explain why he is here. Not because he is brave, but because he has not yet learned what to fear. The journey begins in motion, before the question of direction even appears.

The Fool invites reflection.

Where in my life did I step into something without understanding where it might lead?
What is moving me forward right now — curiosity, or avoidance?

There is no need to decide yet.
This moment is about noticing where the first step actually leads.
