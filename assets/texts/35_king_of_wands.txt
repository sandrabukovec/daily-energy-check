KING OF WANDS

Direction stabilizes through ownership. Energy is no longer reactive or exploratory, but deliberately held and expressed. Influence exists, not through intensity, but through consistency and presence.

This card invites reflection.

Where do I take responsibility for direction rather than momentum?
How do I use influence without needing control?

Leadership shapes the environment.
It also reveals accountability.
