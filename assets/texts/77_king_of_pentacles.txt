KING OF PENTACLES

Material authority stabilizes. Resources are managed with foresight and restraint. Security is maintained through accountability rather than control.

This card invites reflection.

Where do I hold responsibility for long-term stability?
How do my decisions affect material continuity?

Stewardship ensures endurance.
It demands awareness of limits.
