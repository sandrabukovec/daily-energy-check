Curiosity returns in a lighter form. Interest is present without expectation or pressure. Exploration feels possible again, without the need for certainty.

This card invites reflection.

What am I curious about without needing immediate results?
Where can I allow experimentation without outcome?

Openness invites learning.
It does not demand direction.
