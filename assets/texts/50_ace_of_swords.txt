ACE OF SWORDS

Clarity cuts through confusion. A thought, realization, or truth becomes sharply visible. Understanding feels immediate, even if its implications are not yet clear.

This card invites reflection.

What truth has recently become unavoidable?
Where am I seeing something more clearly than before?

Clarity sharpens perception.
It also demands honesty.
