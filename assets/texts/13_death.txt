DEATH

An ending becomes unavoidable. What no longer functions is stripped of justification, habit, and attachment. Space opens not through loss alone, but through finality.

Death invites reflection.

What am I trying to keep alive despite clear signs of closure?
Where am I resisting an ending that has already begun?

Endings remove excess.
They do not explain what comes next.
