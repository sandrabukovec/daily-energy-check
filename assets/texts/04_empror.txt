THE EMPEROR

Structure enters the journey. Limits are drawn, not to restrict movement, but to make it possible. Order appears as a response to vulnerability, a way to hold what has already begun to grow.

The Emperor invites reflection.

Where in my life do I rely on structure to feel safe?
What responsibility have I taken on, willingly or not?

Stability provides ground.
It also reveals where rigidity has replaced trust.
