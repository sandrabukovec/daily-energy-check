THE MAGICIAN

He becomes aware of himself as someone who can act. For the first time, intention appears alongside movement, and choice begins to take shape. What was once instinct now starts to look like direction.

The Magician invites reflection.

Where in my life do I believe I have control, skill, or influence?
Am I acting from clarity, or from the need to prove that I can?

Action changes the situation.
It also reveals responsibility.
