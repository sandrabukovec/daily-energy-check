THE STAR

After disruption, orientation returns quietly. Meaning is no longer forced, but re-emerges through small, honest signals. What guides now is not certainty, but steadiness.

The Star invites reflection.

What gives me a sense of direction without demanding belief?
Where do I notice clarity returning in subtle ways?

Hope does not announce itself loudly.
It becomes visible through consistency.
