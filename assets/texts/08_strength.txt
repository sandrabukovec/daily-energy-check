STRENGTH

Force gives way to endurance. What cannot be dominated must be met with patience and restraint. Power shifts inward, becoming quieter but more demanding.

Strength invites reflection.

What am I trying to overpower instead of understand?
Where does gentleness feel more threatening than force?

Real strength does not rush.
It remains present under pressure.
