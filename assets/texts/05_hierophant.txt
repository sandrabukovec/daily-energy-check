THE HIEROPHANT

He inherits what already exists. Meaning is shaped through rules, traditions, and shared language. Belonging now depends on learning how things are done, not why they began.

The Hierophant invites reflection.

Which beliefs did I adopt without questioning their origin?
Where am I following a structure that no longer fits my experience?

Guidance can offer orientation.
It can also delay personal understanding.
