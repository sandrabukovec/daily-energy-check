TEMPERANCE

Reintegration begins. Elements once held apart are brought into careful relationship. Progress now depends on balance rather than intensity.

Temperance invites reflection.

What parts of my life need adjustment rather than elimination?
Where does moderation feel more difficult than extremes?

Stability is built gradually.
It requires ongoing attention.
