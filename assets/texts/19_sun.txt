THE SUN

Visibility returns. What was hidden, confused, or doubted becomes easier to recognize. Understanding feels lighter, though not necessarily simpler.

The Sun invites reflection.

What truth am I finally able to see clearly?
Where does openness replace hesitation?

Clarity brings warmth.
It also removes excuses.
