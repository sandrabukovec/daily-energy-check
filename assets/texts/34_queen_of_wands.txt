QUEEN OF WANDS

Confidence settles into presence. Energy is expressed with awareness rather than urgency. Engagement becomes grounded, responsive, and self-contained.

This card invites reflection.

Where do I feel comfortable taking up space without proving myself?
How do I relate to my own intensity?

Confidence does not require display.
It sustains itself through consistency.
