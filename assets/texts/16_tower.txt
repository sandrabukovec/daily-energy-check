THE TOWER

Disruption breaks through what was falsely stable. Structures built on avoidance or denial collapse under pressure. 
What remains cannot be rebuilt in the same way.

The Tower invites reflection.

What belief or structure has been protecting me from seeing the truth?
Where has stability depended on suppression?

Collapse exposes what was hidden.
It also clears what cannot be sustained.
