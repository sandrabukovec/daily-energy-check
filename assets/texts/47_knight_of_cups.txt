KNIGHT OF CUPS

Emotion moves toward expression. Feelings seek form through words, gestures, or imagination. Meaning is pursued through idealized connection.

This card invites reflection.

What emotional experience am I reaching for?
Where might idealization be shaping my expectations?

Expression gives emotion direction.
It can also distort reality.
