THE HANGED MAN

Movement stops without warning. What once felt urgent is suspended, and perspective shifts through waiting rather than action. Meaning emerges only when control is released.

The Hanged Man invites reflection.

What am I holding onto that requires me to pause rather than push forward?
Where has stillness revealed something effort could not?

Suspension alters perception.
It does not resolve uncertainty.
