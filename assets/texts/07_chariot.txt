THE CHARIOT

Movement becomes intentional. Direction is chosen not because the path is easy, but because standing still is no longer possible. Control is exercised in response to inner tension, not confidence.

The Chariot invites reflection.

What am I trying to push forward through effort alone?
Where am I confusing determination with avoidance?

Momentum creates distance.
It also hides what is left behind.
