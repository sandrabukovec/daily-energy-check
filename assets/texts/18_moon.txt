THE MOON

Clarity dissolves again, but differently than before. What surfaces now is ambiguous, shaped by memory, fear, and imagination. Not everything encountered here can be trusted at face value.

The Moon invites reflection.

What am I reacting to without fully understanding its source?
Where do assumptions replace direct awareness?

Uncertainty reveals emotional truth.
It also distorts perception.
