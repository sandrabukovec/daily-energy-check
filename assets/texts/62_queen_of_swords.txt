QUEEN OF SWORDS

Clarity settles into discernment. Thought becomes precise, selective, and boundary-aware. Emotional distance allows for honesty without distortion.

This card invites reflection.

Where do I see clearly without needing to soften the truth?
How do I balance insight with detachment?

Discernment protects clarity.
It may limit closeness.
