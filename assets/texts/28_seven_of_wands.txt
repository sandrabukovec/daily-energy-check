Pressure appears from multiple directions. A position feels challenged, even if it was not deliberately claimed. Effort is spent on maintaining ground rather than advancing.

This card invites reflection.

What am I defending right now?
Where do I feel the need to justify my position?

Resistance consumes energy.
It does not always clarify purpose.
