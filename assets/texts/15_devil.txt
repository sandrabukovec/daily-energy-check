THE DEVIL

Attachment tightens its grip. Desire, fear, and dependency blur the line between choice and compulsion. What feels familiar may no longer be freely chosen.

The Devil invites reflection.

What pattern do I return to despite knowing its cost?
Where have I confused comfort with freedom?

Awareness weakens illusion.
It does not remove responsibility.
