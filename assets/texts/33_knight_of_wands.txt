KNIGHT OF WANDS

Energy surges forward impulsively. Action is driven by enthusiasm rather than planning. Movement feels necessary, even if direction shifts quickly.

This card invites reflection.

Where am I acting before fully considering consequences?
What excites me enough to override caution?

Momentum creates experience.
It can also leave instability behind.
