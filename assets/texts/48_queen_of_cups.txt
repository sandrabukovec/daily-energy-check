QUEEN OF CUPS

Emotional awareness deepens. Feelings are held with care rather than urgency. Empathy becomes steady, inwardly anchored.

How do I relate to my own emotional depth?
Where am I holding space rather than reacting?

Emotional presence stabilizes connection.
It requires boundaries to remain clear.
