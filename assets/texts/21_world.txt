THE WORLD

The cycle completes itself. What began without context now carries coherence and limits. Completion here is not perfection, but integration.

The World invites reflection.

What part of my journey now feels whole, even if imperfect?
Where am I ready to move on without needing closure?

Completion marks an ending.
It also makes space for another beginning.
