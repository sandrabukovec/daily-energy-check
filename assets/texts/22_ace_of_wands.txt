ACE OF WANDS

Something new wants attention. Not fully formed, not yet demanding action, but present enough to be felt. It appears as a spark — interest, restlessness, or a sense that something could begin.

This card invites reflection.

What has recently caught my attention without asking for commitment?
Where do I feel a surge of energy that I do not yet understand?

Not every impulse needs to become a plan.
Some beginnings are only meant to be noticed.
