THE HIGH PRIESTESS

She does not move forward, but inward. Knowledge is no longer gathered through action, but through attention and restraint. Some things become clearer only when nothing is forced.

The High Priestess invites reflection.

What am I sensing but not yet acknowledging?
Where am I waiting instead of reacting?

Not everything needs to be revealed immediately.
Some understanding takes shape in silence.
