JUSTICE

Balance is no longer abstract. Actions meet consequences, and perception is tested against reality. What is seen clearly can no longer be ignored.

Justice invites reflection.

What outcome am I responsible for, regardless of intention?
Where am I avoiding an honest assessment of my role?

Clarity demands precision.
It does not offer comfort.
