JUDGEMENT

The past is re-examined, not to repeat it, but to integrate it. What was once unresolved now demands acknowledgment. This moment is less about change than about recognition.

Judgement invites reflection.

What experience from my past is asking to be fully acknowledged?
Where does acceptance matter more than correction?

Recognition alters perspective.
It cannot be undone.
