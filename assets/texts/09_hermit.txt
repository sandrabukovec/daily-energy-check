THE HERMIT

The path narrows. External guidance fades, and attention turns inward. What is sought now cannot be borrowed from others.

The Hermit invites reflection.

What am I stepping away from in order to hear myself more clearly?
What truth becomes visible only in solitude?

Withdrawal sharpens perception.
It also removes distraction.
