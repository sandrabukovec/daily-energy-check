THE EMPRESS

Life begins to take form around her. What was once only an idea now asks for care, time, and presence. Growth is no longer abstract; it becomes visible and tangible.

The Empress invites reflection.

What in my life is asking to be nurtured rather than controlled?
Where am I responsible for what I have already created?

Growth does not happen through pressure.
It happens through sustained care.
