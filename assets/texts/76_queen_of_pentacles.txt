QUEEN OF PENTACLES

Care becomes embodied. Practical responsibility is balanced with attention to well-being. Stability is maintained through presence and nurturing.

This card invites reflection.

How do I care for what depends on me?
Where does tending replace fixing?

Sustainability requires attentiveness.
It is grounded in reality.
