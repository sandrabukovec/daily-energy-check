THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE

Change arrives without asking for consent. Patterns repeat, shift, and reassemble beyond personal control. What rises now may fall later, and what falls is not finished.

The Wheel of Fortune invites reflection.

Where am I attributing meaning to chance?
What cycle do I recognize only after it has already turned?

Movement is inevitable.
Understanding often comes later.
